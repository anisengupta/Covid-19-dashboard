# Covid-19-dashboard
Dashboard that tracks the daily outbreak, death rates and recovery rates of Covid-19 across the globe. This project relies on Google Data Studio in order to make professional looking dashbaord that can help us monitor the situation of Covid-19.  This involved creating a Google API account in order to obtain API credentials in the form of JSON which are stored on the local machine. These are then used to access and write data onto a specified Google Sheet. This is what is connected to the GDS dashboard and is updated daily.

The dashboard can be accessed here: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/c91cb535-325c-4c80-ac90-9f726dc64579/page/qgR

This is a screenshot of the dashboard:
